## About the game:
The game consists of the player trying to eliminate a specific number of enemies.
The game starts with a spaceship whose objective is to destroy the enemy droids that, sporadically, appear and try to avoid the laser shots they perform, in addition to the meteorites that some can be destroyed and thus get these energy to recharge the percentage of energy of the player's ship.
The game ends if the player runs out of power or, at best, has reached the goal of destroying the specified number of droids. If the score obtained at the end of the game is higher than a previous score, it is placed as the new best result.
